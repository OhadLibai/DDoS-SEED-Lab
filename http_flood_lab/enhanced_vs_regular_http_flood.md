| Aspect                | **Enhanced script**                                                                                                              | **Simpler script**                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Traffic diversity** | Multiple HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, etc.), randomized headers, fake IPs, random delays. Harder for a defense system to filter. | Only `GET`, fixed User-Agent, predictable traffic. Easier to detect and block. |
| **Distribution**      | Multiprocessing + threading → can spawn more concurrent requests across CPU cores.                                                       | Threaded only → limited scaling, less CPU utilization.                         |
| **Realism**           | Mimics real browser patterns (headers, jitter, variety of payloads). Makes traffic look “less robotic.”                                  | All requests look almost identical. Easy to fingerprint.                       |
| **Complexity**        | Much heavier code, more moving parts, higher resource consumption on the client side too.                                                | Lightweight, simpler to run, less overhead on the attacking machine.           |
| **Detectability**     | Designed to bypass simple rate-limit or signature-based defenses.                                                                        | Very obvious pattern → trivial to block at WAF/load balancer.                  |
