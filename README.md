# DDoS Attack Labs - SEED Educational Project

## Overview

This repository contains two comprehensive laboratory exercises designed to explore and understand Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in controlled educational environments. The labs provide hands-on experience with different DDoS attack vectors and their impact on web services, while emphasizing defensive cybersecurity practices.

## Educational Context

These labs are part of the broader **SEED (SEcurity EDucation)** project, which provides practical cybersecurity exercises for educational institutions worldwide. The SEED project focuses on learning-by-doing methodology, allowing students to gain practical experience with security concepts through controlled laboratory environments.

## Lab Components

### üåä [HTTP Flood Attack Lab](./http_flood_lab/)
Explores volumetric DDoS attacks that overwhelm server resources through high-volume HTTP requests.

**Key Learning Areas:**
- Understanding volumetric attack patterns
- Server resource exhaustion mechanisms  
- Single-threaded vs multi-threaded server resilience
- Performance impact measurement

### üêå [Slowloris Attack Lab](./slowloris_lab/)
Investigates connection exhaustion attacks that consume server resources with minimal bandwidth usage.

**Key Learning Areas:**
- Low-bandwidth, high-impact attack techniques
- Connection pool exhaustion strategies
- Stealth attack characteristics
- Adaptive attack methodologies

## Key Objectives

### Primary Learning Goals
1. **Attack Vector Understanding** - Comprehend different DDoS attack mechanisms and their characteristics
2. **Infrastructure Impact Analysis** - Observe how different server architectures respond to various attack types
3. **Performance Measurement** - Learn to quantify attack effectiveness and system degradation
4. **Cloud vs Local Comparison** - Evaluate performance differences between local Docker and cloud environments

### Technical Skills Development
- Docker containerization and orchestration
- Network monitoring and analysis
- Performance benchmarking techniques
- Cloud platform deployment (Google Cloud Platform)
- System resource monitoring

## Prerequisites

### Technical Requirements
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed
- Basic command-line proficiency (Linux/Unix)
- **Google Cloud Platform** account (for cloud deployment comparison)
- SSH client for remote access

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of HTTP protocol
- Familiarity with client-server architecture
- Elementary networking concepts (TCP connections, ports)
- Basic cybersecurity awareness

### System Requirements
- **Local Development:**
  - 4GB+ RAM recommended
  - Docker with at least 2GB allocated memory
  - Available ports: 8080

- **Cloud Deployment (GCP):**
  - VM instance with 2+ vCPUs
  - 4GB+ memory
  - Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar Linux distribution

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd DDoS-SEED-lab
```

### 2. Choose Your Lab
- **HTTP Flood Lab**: `cd http_flood_lab/` 
- **Slowloris Lab**: `cd slowloris_lab/`

### 3. Select Lab Variant
- **Part A**: Basic implementation (single-threaded/basic attack)
- **Part B**: Advanced implementation (multi-threaded/adaptive attack)

### 4. Deploy and Monitor
```bash
# Deploy the lab
cd part_A  # or part_B
docker-compose up -d

# Start monitoring (refer to monitoring guides)
watch -n 1 'curl -w "%{time_total}s\n" http://localhost:8080'
```

## Performance Analysis Framework

This project emphasizes **comparative performance analysis** between different deployment environments:
