DDoS SEED Lab - HTTP/2 Protocol Vulnerability Studies

A comprehensive educational laboratory suite for exploring Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting HTTP/2 protocol vulnerabilities. This lab collection provides hands-on experience with modern web protocol exploitation techniques through controlled local environments and real-world cloud deployments.

Learning Objectives

- Protocol Vulnerability Analysis: Understand HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 attack mechanisms
- Performance Impact Assessment: Quantify attack effectiveness and system degradation
- Cloud vs Local Comparison: Evaluate attack performance across different deployment scenarios
- Real-world Attack Simulation: Experience internet-scale attacks using cloud infrastructure

Lab Architecture

Clean Separation Design
All labs implement clean separation between server deployment and attack deployment:
- Deploy servers independently (local or cloud)
- Launch attacks against running servers 
- Real internet simulation: Attack from local machine → cloud servers
- Independent operation: Servers run without attacks, attacks target existing servers

Lab Components

1. HTTP/2 Application Flood Attack Lab (http2-app-flood/)
Focus: HTTP/2 multiplexing exploitation and application-layer flooding

- Part A: Single-worker development environment testing  
- Part B: Multi-worker production-like environment testing
- Attack Types: Basic flood, advanced evasion techniques
- Scenarios: 6 CPU-intensive workload types (CAPTCHA, crypto, gaming, etc.)
- Key Learning: HTTP/2 stream multiplexing vulnerabilities, server resource exhaustion

2. HTTP/2 Flow Control Attack Lab (flow-control/)
Focus: HTTP/2 flow control mechanism exploitation

- Zero-Window Attack: Forces indefinite worker thread blocking
- Slow-Incremental Attack: Sustained resource exhaustion via minimal window updates
- Adaptive-Slow Attack: Intelligent attack adaptation with evasion techniques  
- Key Learning: Protocol-level flow control abuse, connection state manipulation

3. Slowloris Attack Lab (bonus-slowloris/)
Focus: HTTP/1.1 legacy protocol vulnerabilities in HTTP/2 environments

- Basic Slowloris: Traditional incomplete header attacks
- Advanced Slowloris: Modern server evasion with multi-threading
- Cloud Slowloris: Steganographic headers with intelligent adaptation
- Key Learning: Backward compatibility attack vectors, protocol fallback exploitation

Real Internet Testing (GCP Free Tier)
Each lab supports cloud deployment for realistic internet-scale testing:

Monitoring and Analysis:
	- Response Time Testing
	- Bandwidth Consumption
	- Request Rate
	- Error Rates
	- CPU and Memory Usage
	- Thread Pool Depletion
	- Latency Spikes
	- Stream Status
	- TCP Connection Health
	- Average Connection Duration

The lab will be constructed in the form and shape of SEED labs.
A detailed and conclusive analysis file, containing cloud vs. local attack deployments performance delta measures, will also be handed over.
