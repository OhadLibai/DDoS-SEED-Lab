# Cloud Enhanced HTTP/2 Slowloris Attack Features

## Overview
This advanced HTTP/2 Slowloris implementation leverages cloud deployment capabilities and modern HTTP/2 protocol features to demonstrate sophisticated stream exhaustion attacks. The implementation is designed for educational purposes to understand advanced attack vectors and defensive requirements.

## HTTP/2 Enhanced Features

### HTTP/2 Stream Multiplexing
- Multiple slow streams per HTTP/2 connection for efficient resource exhaustion
- Intelligent stream management with HTTP/2 flow control manipulation
- Adaptive stream creation based on server HTTP/2 implementation

### HTTP/2 Protocol Exploitation
- Leverages HTTP/2 multiplexing to maximize impact per connection
- Uses HTTP/2 header compression and frame structures for stealth
- Exploits HTTP/2 stream prioritization and dependency features

## Advanced Evasion Techniques

The implementation includes evasion techniques to counter defense mechanisms:

  IP Diversification
  - Proxy rotation support (--proxies flag)
  - Connection spreading across multiple source IPs

  Steganographic Disguise
  - Realistic user agents and headers from major browsers
  - Keep-alive packets disguised as legitimate analytics/tracking data
  - Headers that mimic real web application behavior

  Adaptive Intelligence
  - Success rate tracking and strategy adaptation
  - Burst mode for high success rates
  - Stealth mode when detection risk is high
  - Connection aging and rotation to avoid timeouts

  Advanced Timing
  - Human-like browsing pattern simulation
  - Intelligent jitter to avoid timing fingerprints
  - Multi-factor sleep calculation based on conditions

  Enhanced Management
  - Gradual connection spawning to avoid rate limits
  - Intelligent replenishment strategies
  - Better error handling and recovery

## Usage Examples

### HTTP/2 Stealth Mode
```bash
# Maximum stealth mode with HTTP/2 multiplexing
python3 cloud_slowloris.py target.com 100 --stealth --adaptive --streams 25

# HTTP/2 with proxy rotation for IP diversification
python3 cloud_slowloris.py target.com 150 --proxies proxies.txt --streams 20

# Custom port with initial HTTP/2 stream burst
python3 cloud_slowloris.py target.com 200 --port 8080 --burst-initial 50 --streams 30
```
