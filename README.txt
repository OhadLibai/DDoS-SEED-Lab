DDoS SEED Lab - HTTP/2 Protocol Vulnerability Studies

A comprehensive educational laboratory suite for exploring Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting HTTP/2 protocol vulnerabilities. This lab collection provides hands-on experience with modern web protocol exploitation techniques through controlled local environments and real-world cloud deployments.

Learning Objectives

- Protocol Vulnerability Analysis: Understand HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 attack mechanisms
- Performance Impact Assessment: Quantify attack effectiveness and system degradation
- Cloud vs Local Comparison: Evaluate attack performance across different deployment scenarios
- Real-world Attack Simulation: Experience internet-scale attacks using cloud infrastructure

Lab Architecture

Clean Separation Design
All labs implement clean separation between server deployment and attack deployment:
- Deploy servers independently (local or cloud)
- Launch attacks against running servers 
- Real internet simulation: Attack from local machine → cloud servers
- Independent operation: Servers run without attacks, attacks target existing servers

Lab Components

1. HTTP/2 Application Flood Attack Lab (http2-app-flood/)
Focus: HTTP/2 multiplexing exploitation and application-layer flooding

- Part A: Single-worker development environment testing  
- Part B: Multi-worker production-like environment testing
- Attack Types: Basic flood, advanced evasion techniques
- Scenarios: 6 CPU-intensive workload types (CAPTCHA, crypto, gaming, etc.)
- Key Learning: HTTP/2 stream multiplexing vulnerabilities, server resource exhaustion

2. HTTP/2 Flow Control Attack Lab (flow-control/)
Focus: HTTP/2 flow control mechanism exploitation

- Zero-Window Attack: Forces indefinite worker thread blocking
- Slow-Incremental Attack: Sustained resource exhaustion via minimal window updates
- Adaptive-Slow Attack: Intelligent attack adaptation with evasion techniques  
- Key Learning: Protocol-level flow control abuse, connection state manipulation

3. Slowloris Attack Lab (bonus-slowloris/)
Focus: HTTP/1.1 legacy protocol vulnerabilities in HTTP/2 environments

- Basic Slowloris: Traditional incomplete header attacks
- Advanced Slowloris: Modern server evasion with multi-threading
- Cloud Slowloris: Steganographic headers with intelligent adaptation
- Key Learning: Backward compatibility attack vectors, protocol fallback exploitation

Quick Start

Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Google Cloud Platform account (free tier, no billing required)
- gcloud CLI installed for cloud deployments
- 4GB+ RAM recommended for local testing

Choose Your Lab Path

Option 1: Start with HTTP/2 Application Floods
cd http2-app-flood
./deploy-server.sh --local part-A
./deploy-attack.sh --local part-A

Option 2: Explore Flow Control Attacks
cd flow-control
./deploy-server.sh local zero-window
./deploy-attack.sh zero-window local --connections 512

Option 3: Study Legacy Protocol Vulnerabilities
cd bonus-slowloris
./deploy-server.sh latest local
./deploy-attack.sh advanced local --logs

Real Internet Testing (GCP Free Tier)

Each lab supports cloud deployment for realistic internet-scale testing:

# One-time GCP setup (run from any lab directory)
./setup-gcp-infrastructure.sh YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Deploy server to cloud
./deploy-server.sh --gcp <lab-specific-options>

# Attack cloud server from local machine
./deploy-attack.sh --gcp <lab-specific-options>

Common Deployment Patterns

Server Deployment
# Local development
./deploy-server.sh --local <options>

# Cloud production testing  
./deploy-server.sh --gcp <options>

# Stop servers
./deploy-server.sh --stop

# Destroy cloud infrastructure
./deploy-server.sh --destruct-vm

Attack Deployment
# Local attacks (to local servers)
./deploy-attack.sh --local <attack-type> <options>

# Cloud attacks (from local to cloud servers)
./deploy-attack.sh --gcp <attack-type> <options>

# Stop all attacks
./deploy-attack.sh --stop

Monitoring and Analysis

Essential Monitoring Commands

Response Time Testing:
# Local server
watch -n 1 'curl -w "Response: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:8080'

# Cloud server  
curl -w "Response: %{time_total}s\n" -o /dev/null -s http://EXTERNAL_IP:8080

Resource Usage:
# Local containers
docker stats --no-stream

# Cloud resources
gcloud compute ssh <instance-name> --command="docker stats --no-stream"

Connection Analysis:
# Active connections
ss -tan | grep :8080 | wc -l

# Container-level connections
docker exec <container> sh -c "awk 'NR>1 && \$4==\"01\" {count++} END {print count+0}' /proc/net/tcp"

Cleanup and Cost Management

Complete Lab Cleanup
# Stop all local resources
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
docker system prune -f

# Destroy all GCP resources
./deploy-server.sh --gcp --destruct-vm  # Run from any lab directory

Cost Management
- GCP VMs auto-shutdown after 2 hours to prevent unexpected charges
- Use --destruct-vm flag to completely remove cloud infrastructure
- Monitor GCP billing dashboard for usage
